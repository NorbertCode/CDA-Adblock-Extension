# CDA Adblock
Incredibly simple and easy to use adblock for cda.pl

Since cda.pl uses a different ad system than most video services, adblocks often don't work. Unfortunately for them it's also extremely easy to bypass.

Tested only on Chrome, but should work on most Chromium browsers.

# Installation
1. Go to Settings -> Extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Either drag and drop .crx file or press "Load unpacked" and select the source files
